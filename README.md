# React Redux Blog

a couple sentence description about what you did

For this project I created a React JS app with ReactRedux used to manage state. I set up reducers and actions to handle most of the api calls and state changes. 

## What Worked

It all worked without many hiccups

## Extra Credit

* I think it looks pretty snazzy
* Input validation when creating a new blog post. Any input left unfilled will turn red if you try to submit.
